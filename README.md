# Force-directed graph layouts revisited: a new force based on the t-Distribution

- **_analysis_**
- **_analysis/\*.ipynb_** python notebook for the source code to analyze the experimental results.
- **_analysis/results_** experimental results.
- **_analysis/Figs_** The figures generated by the code.

---

- **_data_** The copy of all tested graphs except oversized 8 graphs due to github file size limit. But all of them can be found in snap collection[https://snap.stanford.edu/data/index.html].

---

- **_source_code_** Source code for t-FDP.

---

- **_layout_results_** Five repeated layout results generated by all methods.
- **_layout_results/PMDS_init_** The layout results generated by the eight methods with PMDS initialization.
- **_layout_results/RD_init_** The layout results generated by the eight methods with random initialization.
- **_layout_results/Other_** Other three method(PMDS, SFDP and DRGraph).
- **_layout_results/t-FDP_approx_** The layout results generated by four approximation method and the exact method of the t-FDP model.

---

- **_run_tfdp.py_** The code for generating t-FDP layout results.
